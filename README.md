# Bugs and Fixes
   ## **Question counter not resetting** 
- I was having issues where the question counter was not resetting back to 0 when the quiz ended.
   - I solved this by `window.location="./index.html";`. I got the help from [Stack Overflow.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13158786/how-to-return-to-home-page-using-javascript)

   ## **Results counter showing every answer as correct**
- I was having issues where the result counter was showing every answer as being correct.
   - I solved this by adding `finalScore++;` to  `if (correct)` inside of the `selectAnswer` function.

   ## **404 Error page showing**
- I was having issues where a 404 Error Page would show when the user pressed restart.
   - I solved this by changing the file path from `"../index.html"` to `"./index.html"`.

   ## **Grid issues**
- I was having issues while using "Grid" within CSS for the placement of the answer buttons.
   - I solved this with the help of [W3S Schools.](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp)

# Ireland's Quiz
This quiz is based on questions about Ireland.

I created this quiz as a fun little game to test your knowledge on Ireland.

The quiz has 10 questions that show up in random order each time. 

Each question has 4 button options for answers. If you select the correct answer the background and correct answer button turn green. But if you select the wrong answer the background incorrect answer buttons turn red.

   # **Features To Be Added**

# Manual Testing 
  - From the start, the quiz was tested in different browsers (Chrome, Edge and Opera), While using dev tools. This was to make sure everything would run smoothly.
  - I was constantly testing the website on my phone to make sure everything looked good and worked as it should. (Xiaomi Mi 10T Pro)
  - The quiz was also shared to friends to check on their devices - exmaples: Iphone 11 Pro, Iphone 12, Samsung Galaxy S20.
  - I tested that the text was easily readable using the text contrast feature in dev tools.
  - The smallest screen size is recommended at 320px x 745px.
  - I asked for feedback in the "Peer-code-review" channel on slack. This brought a few bugs to my knowledge.
  - I noticed from the Learning Outcomes (6.2 Write code that intelligently handles empty or invalid input data.) That I had not included this. I added a username section that requies a username to play the game. If the user does not input a name there is an alert shown.
  - I tested each button individually to make sure they were working. Examples:
  
   | Feature        |    Expected   | Result       | Test |
   | -------------  |:-------------:| -----:| -----: |
   | Username Section | Allows the user to input a name  - Alert if no username is present.

# Bugs and Fixes
   ## **Question counter not resetting** 
- I was having issues where the question counter was not resetting back to 0 when the quiz ended.
   - I solved this by `window.location="./index.html";`. I got the help from [Stack Overflow.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13158786/how-to-return-to-home-page-using-javascript)

   ## **Results counter**
- I was having issues where the result counter was showing every answer as being correct.
   - I solved this by adding `finalScore++;` to  `if (correct)` inside of the `selectAnswer` function.

   ## **404 Error page showing**
- I was having issues where a 404 Error Page would show when the user pressed restart.
   - I solved this by changing the file path from `"../index.html"` to `"./index.html"`.

   ## **Grid issues**
- I was having issues while using "Grid" within CSS for the placement of the answer buttons.
   - I solved this with the help of [W3S Schools.](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp) `grid-template-columns: repeat(1, auto);` solved my issues.

  ## **Answers position**
- I was having issues where some of the question were going outside the quiz box on smaller devices.
  - I solved this by stacking the answers above each other on smaller devices.

  ## **Form section refreshing**
- I was having issues where the form was resetting after the user hit submit.
  - I solved this with the help of [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73132199/how-to-avoid-page-refresh-when-user-types-in-invalid-form-input) `e.preventDefault();` solved the issue.
